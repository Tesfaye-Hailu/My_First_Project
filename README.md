                               # My_First_Project
                               
The name of the project is Receipe Manager.     

Motivation to do this project is that it is easy to adapt and use the project to any small business organizations.

Here below are the features of the project:
The aim of this project is to display available ingredients to the user.
It will give options to add new ingredients by the receipe owner.
Then, the user can select any ingredients of his/her choice from the available list. 
If the list is not available, there is a prompt that says the selected ingredients is/are not in the list.
It will display both available and selected ingredients. 
There are dishes, which are being produced by combining some ingredients. Hence, the system will give options to the user to order the dishes(if he/she is interested).
Finally, it will re-set the selected items for next user.

The system will check duplications of ingredients both on adding additional ingredients and selecting ingredients before clicking the re-set button. This will serve as a control mechanism from the user and receipe owner side.

The system is not case sensitive. It will check only spelling check.

This project is good because, it will be  easy to adapt for any small business. It is very easy to use by the user or the receipe owner.

The provided code defines a class called IngredientList that manages a list of ingredients and allows the user to select ingredients from the list. It also provides a method called displayRecipes that displays recipe options based on the selected ingredients. The recipes are defined in an array of dish objects with names and lists of ingredients. The code uses event listeners and DOM manipulation to enable user interaction and display the results.

I have tested it and it is functioning the intended task.

I would like to thank my instructor , Mr Chase , for his close support and guidances in all the process of this project.
